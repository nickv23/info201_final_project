### How to Use Our App!
### Our Data:
Our data comes from [College Scorecard Data](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). 
### Our Audience:
Our target audience are high school students and college students who are in the process of finding colleges they want to apply to and attend. They will want to know basic information about each college such as location, diversity, ACT/SAT scores, admission acceptance rates, and tuition costs.

### Our widgets:
